Hello, my name is Rafael Macedo Vitor, currently 20 years old.  
I've been coursing software engineering at Inatel for almost a year for now.  

Most of my projects are about things i've found interesting and tried do achive with js canvas.  
Mostly are 5h to 10h projects with some updates here and there.  

Recently started to pick an interest in SDL with c++ and been practicing with it, just one here on git though.
